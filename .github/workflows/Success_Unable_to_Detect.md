# Internet connected but still cannot display devices in local network

## Make sure.. 
- Make sure all devices have installed this software.
- Make sure all devices are in the same network (in different frequency is ok, e.g. 2.4g / 5g)

## What might cause this issue? 
### AP Isolation has been engaged in the network setting (usually the network in cafeteria and school will turn this option on). 
To solve: if you have the access to the network administrator access, you can turn this option off. 

### Client Isolation
Client Isolation, same as AP Isolation, might block the internal communication between devices in the same network. Make sure client isolation is off.
