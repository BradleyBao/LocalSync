# Internet connected but still cannot display devices in local network
## Solution 
- Make sure all devices have installed this software.
- Make sure all devices are in the same network (in different frequency is ok, e.g. 2.4g / 5g)
- Make sure the AP Isolation in network setting has been disabled (network in cafeteria / school usually turn on this option).
- Other router setting: some routers have set certain security settings that might block the regular communication between internal network.
- Make sure the client isolation has been disabled.
